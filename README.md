# Codecademy Dictionaries Hurricane Project

In this project, I practiced data processing and manipulation using dictionaries. 

The data and code challenge are provided by Codecademy, in the "Data Scientist" path. 

The requirements and assignments as provided by Codecademy can be found embedded in the Jupyter notebook.
